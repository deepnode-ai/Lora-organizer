# Models-organizer
simple app for displaying models images stored in the Models directory and subdirectories - similar to what A1111 application has.

#### Key Benefits:

- Developers and AI Artists who need a streamlined way to navigate visually AI models and digital assets in models in ComfyUI.
- Wildcard encode tag with the model name and weight to post in the wildcard encosde prompt area `Add lora`


## Preparing the Application

### Structure:
Ensure your project directory is structured as follows:
```
ComfyUI/
├── models/
│   └── app.py        # Your Streamlit application
└── ...               # Other directories and files as needed
```

### Launch Streamlit:
Run the Streamlit application by navigating to the models folder and running app.py.
```
streamlit run app.py
```
or
use `steamlit-dy.sh` to run the app after editing env variables
```
./steamlit-dy.sh
```
